# EAS packaging ignore rules

# If present, EAS uses this file instead of .gitignore when creating the tarball for the build.

# Keep node_modules and build outputs excluded to shrink upload size.

node_modules
.expo
dist
web-build

# Allow native folders to be generated on the server (managed workflow)

ios
android

# Do NOT ignore google-services.json so it gets uploaded to EAS

# (We keep it in the repo and ensure it's packaged for builds.)

# Intentionally no rule to exclude google-services.json here.
